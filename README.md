# Fast-Inverse-Square-Root-multiple-languages
This is an algorithm that estimatesthe reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the square root of a 32-bit floating-point number 'x' in IEEE 754 floating-point format. This operation is used in digital signal processing to normalize a vector, i.e., scale it to length 1 <br/>
Still a work in progress
